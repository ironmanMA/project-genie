Welcome to five minutes in church history hosted by dr steven nichols where we take a little break from the president to go exploring the past travel back in time as we look for people events and even the places that have shaped the story of christianity this's our story family history let's get started well welcome back to another episode of five minutes in church history this is part two last time we were together we had dr dole's all with us and here he is again dr dole's all welcome thank you. Thanks for having me good to have you were talking about the history of the doctrine of god and last time we talked about the unity of god the tri unity of god and that god is a trinity and then we talked about and here's a tongue twister unfathomable nous of god and that right that's where he left us so thank you for that we've got this solid foundation let's go from there what next do we need to see or what do we see in the history of this doctor good. Some of the early attributes that are confessed are attributes like god's simplicity which is thea argument that god is not composed of parts god does not have his god nous as the result of his attributes sort of being added together and making god god so that god is not the summation of something more basic than himself and i think this is really driven in the early church by their deep fundamental commitment to god as the absolute creator of heaven and earth and all that is in them if god is the one from whom and through whom and to whom are all things is romans eleven thirty six says then god can't be composed of parts because things that are composed of parts actually have sources of being more basic than themselves parts are constituents on which holes depend and since god does not depend upon anything that is not god in order to be god he must be simple in fact here in areas in his great work against harris ese it's an early apology for the church's confession and belief and he makes a statement in there about divine simplicity and he says that all the pious are want to speak this way concerning god and you get the sense that early on here in the late second century a doctrine like simplicity is already sort of doctrine of god one o one it's standard language and the church is thinking about very few people talk about that when they talk about the nature of god and the attributes of god very few start with simplicity and in fact it sounds wrong to us perhaps the first goddess simple seems insulting blast from a soldier's if i called you simplistic yes that wouldn't be a compliment i might not have you back you not if i call god's simple though i'm not saying that god's simplistic or even easy to understand i heard you say this and you said you say this to your students here's where we can see how this sort of connects to living the christian life if god were made of parts he'd fall apart that's right yeah is that my getting that quite i think you're getting at the sense of it because the whole point of god's simplicity especially for the christian is that if god is simple god does not depend upon something other than himself to be himself and it's for this reason that god is absolutely and utterly dependable on i will say to my students the reason you can utterly depend upon god is because he won't fall apart and the reason he won't fall apart is because he wasn't made of parts to begin with that's beautiful well thank you for that's the simplicity of god i wanna ask you about one more word i hear some people call this a c a t some say a society a society what is the city of god? This is that christian doctrine that argues that god is of himself all say the latin of himself which means that the reason for god is god and that god does not in any respect depend upon something not himself in order to you know what he knows to do what he does, that the ultimate reason for anything you say god is, or does is in fact, just god in his perfection of god, nous the early church is very insistent on these attributes on the absolute irreducible ity of god in his glory, we're back again to the unfathomable nous of god. Only this we are, and from that comes his goodness to us, to his creatures, heyman. Thank you, dr dole's, all for helping us get a little bit of insight here into the history of the doctrine of god.
